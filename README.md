# miranda-irc-for-jaws
JAWS scripts for the Miranda IRC chat client for auto announcement of chat messages.

Intro
-----

[Uploaded for the W3C ARIA Working Group]

This includes the JAWS Script files for the portable Miranda IRC client to enable automatic announcement of chat messages.

The original author of the script files is unknown, but the script files have been recently modified to more reliably announce incoming messages.

How To Use
-----

# Copy the files within the JAWS Script Files into the JAWS For Windows script files folder.
# Within the Miranda IM folder, activate miranda.exe to run the client. (It should automatically be minimized to your task tray.)
# Within the task tray, right click the "MyIRC" icon, then open "Main Menu" > "MyIRC" > "Quick Connect", then enter the IRC server address to connect to.
# After the server is connected (takes a few seconds), then right click the "MyIRC" icon, then open "Main Menu" > "MyIRC" > "Join Channel", and enter the IRC channel to join.

A new chat dialog window should open, and the JAWS For Windows screen reader should now announce all incoming messages when the window has focus.
